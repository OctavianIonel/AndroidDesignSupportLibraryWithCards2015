### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
According to Google I/O 2015, this is the newest Android Support Design library. It includes: CoordinatorLayout, AppBarLayout (Toolbar & TabLayout), NavigationView, FloatingActionButton, Snackbar. My project is showing an example of this library, which includes Material Design Cards. It loads a different toolbar based on the selected fragment, because in FragmentOfferte fragment, I am loading two other fragments (Fragment1 and Fragment2). To view these 2 fragments, one has to click on the tabs of swipe the screen (using ViewPager).
